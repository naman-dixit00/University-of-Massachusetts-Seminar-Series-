## 📄 Abstract
Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the creativity and reasoning of human experts?

We present **Glia**, an AI architecture for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback.

Unlike prior ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload behavior.

💡 *Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems.*

Zaroor, buddy! Ek professional aur clear **Disclaimer/Citation** section likhna bahut zaroori hota hai jab aap kisi university ka content use kar rahe ho.

Aap apni GitHub README mein niche diya gaya text copy-paste kar sakte ho. Maine ise kaafi respectful aur "fair use" friendly rakha hai taaki koi issue na ho.
